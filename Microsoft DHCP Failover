<h1> Setting Up Microsoft Server DHCP Failover<h1></h1>
 I completed a lab on configuring DHCP failover between two Windows Server 2019 domain controllers. I did run into some difficulties which gave me the opportunity to use some real-world troubleshooting.</h1>
<br />


<h2>What I Accomplished </h2>

- Configured Server Manager to manage multiple servers remotely
- Installed and configured DHCP role with custom scope
- Set up IP exclusions and lease durations
- Successfully activated the scope and verified client IP assignment


<h2>Failover Configuration</h2>

- Implemented Hot Standby mode between two domain controllers
- Configured partner server relationships with shared secrets
- Set up maximum client lead time and standby server address allocation

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
I did come across some challenges during this lab but this was a valuable learning experience for me:

𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐞#1 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐃𝐇𝐂𝐏 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬 My Windows 10 client kept getting IP addresses I had excluded. After investigating, I discovered the firewall/router had its on DHCP server running. I had to access the M0n0wall web GUI to disable the competing service. This is a good reminder to check all devices and not just one that you are working on.

𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐞#2 𝐃𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐢𝐠𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐌𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞 The biggest learning moment came trying to set up failover between servers. I had accidently created a new forest instead of adding the second server to the existing domain. This prevented the failover configuration entirely and required rebuilding the virtual machine.
