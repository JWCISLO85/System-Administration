<h1> Setting Up Microsoft Server DHCP Failover<h1></h1>
 I completed a lab on configuring DHCP failover between two Windows Server 2019 domain controllers. I did run into some difficulties which gave me the opportunity to use some real-world troubleshooting.</h1>
<br />


<h2>Skills Learned </h2>
𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐒𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐥 𝐀𝐝𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Learned the differences between running PowerShell as a regular user vs Administrator. This elevated privileges eliminated user account control prompts when making changes to the system such as software installation and permission modifications.

𝐍𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐓𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: Used ping and nslookup
𝐏𝐢𝐧𝐠:Tests connectivity between systems.
𝐍𝐬𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐮𝐩: Queries DNS servers to resolve domain names to IP addresses (and vice versa) an essential tool for diagnosing network connectivity issues.

𝐃𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
Successfully joined a Windows 10 client to Windows Server domain using PowerShell commands. This hands-on experience taught me how domain authentication works and why systems go through initial set up processes when first joining a domain. This is all about about applying Group Policy and integrating with centralized management.

<h2>What I learned </h2>
 The lab reinforced how Group Policy enables organizations to maintain consistent configurations across all domain-joined machines, providing centralized control and standardized user experiences.

System administration is not just about knowing commands, it is about understanding underlying network architecture and security implications of each action.
