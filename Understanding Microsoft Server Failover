<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
I completed this project to observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark to gain a better understanding of Firewalls and protocols. <br />





<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDP, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>Steps</h2>

- Created two virtual machines in Azure one Windows 10 and One Ubuntu Server
- Used ping command to test connectivity between the two machines
- Installed Wireshark
- Used Wireshark to filter and analyze traffic
- Created an Inbound security rule in Azure Security Group
- Used ssh in powershell to connect to Ubuntu server command line

<h2>Analyzing ICMP Network Traffic</h2>
